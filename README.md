# 🛡️ TrueDawg.exe — Your First Line of Defense

"TrueDawg.exe" is built for one purpose: keeping you safe by verifying the authenticity of *my* tools and scripts. If you receive a file — or download something stamped with my name — don’t trust it blindly. "Verify it first."

## ✅ How It Works

Every legit file I release comes with a "unique signature" — a plain text string that proves the file hasn’t been tampered with.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Verification:
1. Copy the signature that came with the file.
2. Launch "TrueDawg.exe".
3. Paste the signature into the app.
4. Select the file you received.
5. Click "Verify".

## 🔒 What to Look For

- "Signature Matches?"  
  You’re clear. It’s verified, authentic, and safe to run.

- "No Match?"  
  Stop right there. Don’t rename it. Don’t open it. "Delete it immediately."  
  Even the tiniest modification — a character tweak or filename change — will break the signature. That’s your red flag.

## 📌 Important Notes

- The official "TrueDawg.exe" signature is included — verify the tool itself before use.
- "TrueDawg works ONLY with my tools and scripts."  
  If a file fails verification, it’s *not from me*. Simple as that.

## 🧠 Why Signature Verification Matters

You don’t need to run a file to verify it. That’s the beauty of signatures — they’re just text.

> "Copy the signature. Paste it into TrueDawg. Done."

It’s the safest way to confirm a file’s legitimacy *without ever executing it*.

## 🔗 Final Word

Stay sharp.  
"Trust the signature — not the source."
